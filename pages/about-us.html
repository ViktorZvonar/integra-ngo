            We create various local programs, projects and events using a
            non-formal approach in the fields of education, culture,
            entrepreneurship, sports and healthy living. We are actively
            involved in Lebork's green movement. Our primary focus is on
            individuals from diverse backgrounds and age groups. Together with
            them, we design workshops and initiatives covering a wide range of
            topics, such as education, human rights, active citizenship,
            participation, democracy, tolerance, preventing radicalization,
            promoting diversity, multiculturalism, sports and fostering a
            healthy lifestyle.
